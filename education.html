      <h3> High School </h3>
      <p> Attended Walkerville Collegiate Institute from September 2008 until June 2013 and received
        my Ontario Secondary School Diploma with Specialist High Skills Major in Music in 2012.
        To obtain a Specialist High Skills Major on an OSSD a student must obtain credits for
        various courses in a specific discipline. For me this was music. I specialized in
        guitar, trumpet, saxophone and piano during my time at WCI. I also took classes on
        music theory, composition, orchestration and took a co-op where I taught music at a
        gradeschool to all ages and students who are differently abled.
        I returned to attend WCI after I had graduated to obtain extra courses in math and science
        so I could attend the University of Windsor.</p>
      <h3> University </h3>
      <p> Attended the University of Windsor for two years from September 2013 until June 2015 and
        received credits for various courses such as: physics, chemistry, math, philosophy and astronomy.
        I ended up deciding on a different career path for myself and took a year off to work a bit
        before continuing with my education.</p>
      <h3> College </h3>
      <p> I have been attending Sir Sandford Fleming College from September 2016 and have since
        obtained my Forestry Technician diploma. I am not currently enrolled in the GIS - 
        Cartography Specialist Post Graduate Certificate program. I am expecting to graduate from
        the post-grad program in the summer of 2021.</p>
