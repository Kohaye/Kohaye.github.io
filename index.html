      <article> <h3> Profile </h3>
        <p> I'm a man who craves adventure and the outdoors. I'm always doing something outside in
            my free time whether it's fishing, hunting, wandering the woods with my dog or just
            staring at the majesty of trees. I grew up in the city of Windsor, and for my whole
            life I wanted to get away and live near forested areas so I can learn how to do the
            activities I've dreamed about as a child. I'm most interested in passing my love and
            knowledge of the outdoors to my daughter who is already showing signs because she hates
            being cooped up when there's a whole world out there for her to explore.<br><br>
            My first priority, of course, is being a dad. I'm trying to lead by example by getting
            a stellar education to obtain a job that I will enjoy doing. Currently I have a Forestry
            Technician diploma from Sir Sandford Fleming college and I'm in the GIS: Cartography
            Specialist post-graduate program. That being said I'm still doing as much as I can with my
            daughter while maintaining good standing with my studies. I dedicate as much time as possible
            to giving my daughter the attention she deserves. It's quite the challenge balancing home life
            and school but I feel like I'm doing rather well, given the circumstance. Every Friday when
            classes are done, it's just me and the little ladybug because her mom goes to work as a 
            veterinary technician. She works every Friday and Saturday, so those days are my dedicated
            baby days and they are the days of the week that I look forward to the most each and every
            week. Being a dad has been one of the greatest experiences of my life and I wouldn't trade it
            for anything in the world. I'm so glad I get to be one for the rest of my life.<br><br>
            The main reason why I decided to enter the post-graduate program is because during my time
            in the Forestry Technician program, I developed a love for creating maps. I have a lot of 
            fun using the various softwares to create visual representations of something that's trying
            to be communicated in a way only a map can. I've created maps that showcase trails on 
            a person's property. I've created a map for myself when I went on a crown land canoe trip.
            I've also created a map to show various deciduous and coniferous forest areas around where 
            I hunt, with contours, to try to predict where deer and moose may be located at any given
            time. There's such a plethora of concepts that can be communicated through the use of maps
            and the artistry behind their creation is a beautiful science.<br><br>
            I'm also trying to teach myself how to hunt with a recurve bow. It was gifted to me many
            years ago, before I moved to the Kawarthas, and I never really practiced with it until
            this year. I'm hoping to use it when I go on this year's moose hunt during 
            the break in the fall semester. Each time I need a break from doing schoolwork, I go
            out into the back yard and fire off a bunch of arrows at a target about 20 yards away.
            It's a great break from school and a great way to dedicate some time towards being
            a better archer, and ensuring that if I ever get the chance at harvesting an animal,
            it's a clean and ethical ending.
