        <h3> High School </h3>
        <p> Attended Walkerville Collegiate Institute from September 2008 until June 2013 and received
          my Ontario Secondary School Diploma with Specialist High Skills Major in Music in 2012.
          To obtain a Specialist High Skills Major on an OSSD a student must obtain credits for
          various courses in a specific discipline. For me this was music. I specialized in
          guitar, trumpet, saxophone and piano during my time at WCI. I also took classes on
          music theory, composition, orchestration and took a co-op where I taught music at a
          gradeschool to all ages and students who are differently abled.
          I returned to attend WCI after I had graduated to obtain extra courses in math and science
          so I could attend the University of Windsor.</p>
        <h3> University </h3>
        <p> Attended the University of Windsor for two years from September 2013 until June 2015 and
          received credits for various courses such as: physics, chemistry, math, philosophy and astronomy.
          I ended up deciding on a different career path for myself and took a year off to work a bit
          before continuing with my education.</p>
        <h3> College </h3>
        <p> I have been attending Sir Sandford Fleming College from September 2016 and have since
          obtained my Forestry Technician diploma. I am not currently enrolled in the GIS - 
          Cartography Specialist Post Graduate Certificate program. I am expecting to graduate from
          the post-grad program in the summer of 2021.</p>
