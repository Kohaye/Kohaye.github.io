          I'm a man who craves adventure and the outdoors. I'm always doing something outside in
          my free time whether it's fishing, hunting, wandering the woods with my dog or just
          staring at the majesty of trees. I grew up in the city of Windsor, and for my whole
          life I wanted to get away and live near forested areas so I can learn how to do the
          activities I've dreamed about as a child. I'm most interested in passing my love and
          knowledge of the outdoors to my daughter who is already showing signs because she hates
          being cooped up when there's a whole world out there for her to explore.</p>
          <p>
          My first priority, of course, is being a dad. I'm trying to lead by example by getting
          a stellar education to obtain a job that I will enjoy doing. Currently I have a Forestry
          Technician diploma from Sir Sandford Fleming college and I'm in the GIS: Cartography
          Specialist post-graduate program. That being said I'm still doing as much as I can with my
          daughter while maintaining good standing with my studies. I dedicate as much time as possible
          to giving my daughter the attention she deserves. It's quite the challenge balancing home life
          and school but I feel like I'm doing rather well, given the circumstance. Every Friday when
          classes are done, it's just me and the little ladybug because her mom goes to work as a 
          veterinary technician. She works every Friday and Saturday, so those days are my dedicated
          baby days and they are the days of the week that I look forward to the most each and every
          week. Being a dad has been one of the greatest experiences of my life and I wouldn't trade it
          for anything in the world. I'm so glad I get to be one for the rest of my life.</p>
          <p>
          The main reason why I decided to enter the post-graduate program is because during my time
          in the Forestry Technician program, I developed a love for creating maps. I have a lot of 
          fun using the various softwares to create visual representations of something that's trying
          to be communicated in a way only a map can. I've created maps that showcase trails on 
          a person's property. I've created a map for myself when I went on a crown land canoe trip.
          I've also created a map to show various deciduous and coniferous forest areas around where 
          I hunt, with contours, to try to predict where deer and moose may be located at any given
          time. There's such a plethora of concepts that can be communicated through the use of maps
          and the artistry behind their creation is a beautiful science.</p>
          <p>
          I'm also trying to teach myself how to hunt with a recurve bow. It was gifted to me many
          years ago, before I moved to the Kawarthas, and I never really practiced with it until
          this year. I'm hoping to use it when I go on this year's moose hunt during 
          the break in the fall semester. Each time I need a break from doing schoolwork, I go
          out into the back yard and fire off a bunch of arrows at a target about 20 yards away.
          It's a great break from school and a great way to dedicate some time towards being
          a better archer, and ensuring that if I ever get the chance at harvesting an animal,
          it's a clean and ethical ending.</p>
